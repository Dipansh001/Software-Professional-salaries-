							"Overview"

	This SQL project analyzes salary data from different job titles and companies, using a dataset from Kaggle. 
	The dataset includes company names, job titles, salaries, ratings, and employment statuses. 
	I used advanced SQL queries to explore salary trends, find differences between companies, and identify any unusually high or low salaries. 
	The project also looked at how factors like company rating and employment type (full-time or intern) affect salaries. 
	The analysis gave useful insights into salary patterns, helping both job seekers and companies understand the pay landscape better.
